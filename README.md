# ReactApp

# Hi iam Bandreddy Eswar Sai
# I have created this food ordering application called PARCEL Which is still under development

# We are going to create an application that delivers a homely food
# NOTE : Double quotes are not required for running commands I just used them to higlight the command.
# requirements - you should have node installed and if you have any CORS policy error just install CORS Allow Cross Origin extension from the chrome store and toggle it ON
# If CORS extension is not toggling ON in chrome browser for just hosting in local use edge or mozilla because i saw edge is workin on most devices.

# How to run this app
# step 1 - Clone this repository
# Step 2 - Open the terminal after cloning is completed
# Step 3 - Run the command - "npm install" (This will download or incoporate all the necessary node modules required to run this application).
# Step 4 - Now to Run the application in dev mode Run the command - "npm run develop"
# Step 5 - That's it application will be hosted in our local in port no.1234

# -- visit localhost:1234 to view our application

# if you want to build the application for production level you can run - "npm run build"

# THANK YOU
